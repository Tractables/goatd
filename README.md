Tree decompositions of graphs, as a Rust library and command-line solver. The
portfolio runs several constructions and keeps the narrowest result:

- **portfolio search** — safe reductions, several seeds and construction
  methods, then optional separator refinement;
- **greedy elimination** — min-fill and min-degree, with deterministic or
  weighted-sampling tie breaking. Repeated min-fill runs sample from a band
  just above the minimum score, so different seeds reach different orders on
  graphs where the minimum is held by one vertex at a time;
- **nested dissection** — recursive multilevel bisection, with each separator
  eliminated after its two sides;
- **flow-based separation** — balanced cuts for constructing and refining
  decompositions. goatd includes a Rust FlowCutter separator search and the
  vendored PACE 2017 FlowCutter decomposer.

See [Algorithms](docs/algorithms.md) for the details and the differences from
the upstream methods.

## Solver

```sh
cargo install goatd
goatd graph.gr > graph.td
```

`goatd` reads and writes the PACE `.gr` and `.td` formats. Choose `--order
minfill`, `mindegree`, `nested-dissection`, `flowcutter`, or `portfolio`; run
`goatd --help` for budgets, seeds, weighted ties, and refinement. The same
solver runs [in the browser](https://tractables.github.io/goatd/).

## Library

```toml
[dependencies]
goatd = "0.1"
```

The [`basic` example](examples/basic.rs) constructs a graph, computes a
decomposition, validates it, and writes it in PACE format:

```sh
cargo run --example basic
```

The public API also exposes graph and hypergraph bisection, the Rust separator
search, the C++ FlowCutter decomposer, and decomposition projection and
refinement. Rustdoc documents each entry point.

## Bindings

The same constructions are available through
[Python](bindings/python/README.md), [C and C++](bindings/c/README.md), and
[WebAssembly](bindings/wasm/README.md).

## Evaluation

The [solver comparison](https://tractables.github.io/goatd/comparison/) runs
the shipped portfolio and seven public baselines on 9,413 selected component
graphs derived from Model Counting Competition formulas. Each receives ten
seconds on one CPU.

<!-- Generated table; 9,413 selected graphs. -->

| Solver | Nontrivial | Exact best | Within +1 | Within +4 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| goatd portfolio | **9,345 (99.3%)** | **8,862 (94.1%)** | **9,131 (97.0%)** | **9,200 (97.7%)** |
| Jdrasil heuristic | 9,095 (96.6%) | 1,078 (11.5%) | 2,509 (26.7%) | 5,591 (59.4%) |
| Tamaki PACE 2017 | 8,240 (87.5%) | 715 (7.6%) | 1,365 (14.5%) | 3,392 (36.0%) |
| HTD | 9,139 (97.1%) | 315 (3.3%) | 446 (4.7%) | 1,909 (20.3%) |
| FlowCutter PACE 2017 | 9,115 (96.8%) | 304 (3.2%) | 459 (4.9%) | 2,118 (22.5%) |
| NetworkX min-degree | 8,999 (95.6%) | 138 (1.5%) | 153 (1.6%) | 227 (2.4%) |
| NetworkX min-fill | 8,279 (88.0%) | 58 (0.6%) | 168 (1.8%) | 1,523 (16.2%) |
| Arboretum heuristic | 5,549 (59.0%) | 32 (0.3%) | 102 (1.1%) | 991 (10.5%) |

Every decomposition is checked by the same validator. The default selection
omits graphs where pinned NetworkX min-degree returns a validated width below
30. “Nontrivial” means a validated decomposition narrower than `|V| - 1`.
“Exact best” is the smallest width observed among the displayed solvers, not a
proven optimum.
